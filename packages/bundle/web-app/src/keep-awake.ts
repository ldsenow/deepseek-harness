/**
 * The web app's host sleep inhibitor: while enabled, holds a platform
 * keep-awake child for the dsh process lifetime so idle sleep cannot cut off
 * running sessions or paired LAN devices. The inhibitor is the platform's own
 * facility — `caffeinate -i` on macOS, `systemd-inhibit` on Linux, a PowerShell
 * `SetThreadExecutionState` holder on Windows — so the OS drops the lock when
 * that child exits, and disposal is what ends it. A dsh killed abruptly
 * (`SIGKILL`, power loss) runs no disposer and orphans the child, which holds
 * the inhibitor until it is killed or the machine restarts. A spawn that
 * produces no pid rejects activation: a deployment that asked to stay awake
 * must never silently serve without it. A child that dies later logs a warning
 * and serving continues.
